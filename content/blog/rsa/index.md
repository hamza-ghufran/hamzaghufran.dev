RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. 
A Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys:
- Public key : can be shared with everyone.
- Private key: must be kept secret.

## What principle is the RSA based on ? 

It is based on the principle that it is easy to multiply large numbers, but factoring large numbers is very difficult.

```
577 * 719 => 414863   [easy to do]
factors of 414863 ?   [a longer process]
```

For all practical purposes, even computers cannot factor large numbers into the product of two primes, in the same way that factoring a number like 414863 by hand is virtually impossible.

## Keys: 

- The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. 

```
n = p * q , where p & q are the two large prime numbers.
```

A user can then distribute his public key `pq`, and anyone seeking to send a message to the user would encrypt their message using the public key.

- The private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers.

So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. 
Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially.

## Key Concepts

In order to understand the inner workings of RSA, let's revist some of the number theory concepts we would have encountered in our college/school years: 

First, let's have a quick look at the followings: 

- `Factors`

Multiplying two whole numbers gives a product. The numbers that we multiply are the factors of the product.  

```
 4 * 8      =     32
_______         _______
factors         product
```

In other words: 

is 4 a factor of 32 ? 
4 is the `divisor` and 32 is the `dividend` here.

```
32 / 4  

results: 
8 as quotient. Q
0 as remainder. R
```
A remainder = 0 tells us that the divisor `4` is a factor of the dividend `32`

* Factors are always whole numbers or integers and never decimals or fractions.

- `Prime numbers`

Thou a pretty straightforward concept, but as you learn to play with it you will see that there are actually fairly sophisticated concepts that can 
be built on top of the idea of a prime number. And that includes the idea of cryptography. 

So, what does it mean to be a prime number ?

A number is a prime if it is a natural number which is divisible by exactly two natural numbers: 
1. First, the number itself.
2. one

Eg. 
1 is not a prime: read more about it [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/why-isnt-1-a-prime-number/)
2 is divisible by 1 and by 2 itself and not another natural number. The only even number that is prime.
So on ..

```
The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100)

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
```

- `Relatively Prime`

Two integers are relatively prime when there are no common factors other than 1. This means that no other integer could divide both numbers evenly. Two integers  ùëé,ùëè  are called relatively prime to each other if  gcd(ùëé,ùëè)=1 .

Note: that neither integers need to be prime in order for them to be relatively prime 8 and 15 are both not prime, yet they are relatively prime.

- `GCD`

As we know from grade school, when we divide one integer by another (nonzero) integer we get an integer quotient (the "answer") plus a remainder (generally a rational number). For instance,
13/5 = 2 ("the quotient") + 3/5 ("the remainder").
We can rephrase this division, totally in terms of integers, without reference to the division operation:
13 = 2(5) + 3.
Note that this expression is obtained from the one above it by multiplying through by the divisor 5.
We refer to this way of writing a division of integers as the Division Algorithm for Integers. More formally stated:

If a and b are positive integers, there exist integers unique non-negative integers q and r so that
a = qb + r , where 0[less than or equal]r < b.
q is called the quotient and r the remainder.
The greatest common divisor of integers a and b, denoted by gcd(a,b), is the largest integer that divides (without remainder) both a and b. So, for example:

gcd(15, 5) = 5,	gcd(7, 9) = 1,	gcd(12, 9) = 3,	gcd(81, 57) = 3.
The gcd of two integers can be found by repeated application of the division algorithm, this is known as the Euclidean Algorithm. You repeatedly divide the divisor by the remainder until the remainder is 0. The gcd is the last non-zero remainder in this algorithm. The following example shows the algorithm.

Finding the gcd of 81 and 57 by the Euclidean Algorithm:

81 = 1(57) + 24
57 = 2(24) + 9
24 = 2(9) + 6
9 = 1(6) + 3
6 = 2(3) + 0.

....

Apart from public key cryptography a few other areas where prime numbers are also used in computing are: 
* [checksums]()
* [hash tables]()
* [pseudorandom number generators]()

### How does the public key cryptography works: 

Rolling pre-credit scene-

l'acteur:  Bob
l'actrice: Alice


<insert> the whole walk thru


Overview of the algorithm, in the enxt section we will break it up into parts and analyze each step

1. To begin, Alice selects two large prime numbers, p and q. Their product will be half of the public key, n=pq.

2. Alice then calculates `œï(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)` and chooses a number e relatively prime to `œï(pq)`. In practice, e is often chosen to be `2^{16}+1=655372` though it can be as small as 3 in some cases. e will be the other half of the public key.

3. Next, she calculates the modular inverse `d of e modulo œï(n).` 
The resulting d is the private key of Alice.

4. Alice distributes both portions of the public key: n and e, but d she keeps it to herself.

## The Algorithm Part 1: Generating the public key

Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message: 
For the sake of simplicity let `p = 7` & `q = 11`

The implementation of RSA makes heavy use of modular arithmetic, Euler's theorem, and Euler's totient function. 
Let's explore these concepts and some examples to understand as to what is happening under the hood.

### Euler's totient function

Written using the Greek letter phi as `œï(n)` and may also be called Euler's phi function.

In number theory, Euler's totient function counts `the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n`.
It is the number of integers `k in the range 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n` for which the greatest common divisor `gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.`

let n = 9

```
for k in the range 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 9: positive integers up to 9

k = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

```
Integers that are relatively prime to 9

gcd(1, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(2, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(3, 9) = 3 ‚ùå
gcd(4, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(5, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(6, 9) = 3 ‚ùå
gcd(7, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(8, 9) = 1 ‚úÖ 
gcd(9, 9) = 3 ‚ùå

Thus, 1,2,4,5,7,8 are relatively prime to 9

œï(9) = 6
```

For any prime number x $$œï(x) = x - 1$$

```
For eg. œï(7) = 6

gcd(1, 7) = 1 
gcd(2, 7) = 1 
gcd(3, 7) = 1 
gcd(4, 7) = 1 
gcd(5, 7) = 1 
gcd(6, 7) = 1
```

Have a look [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modern-crypt/pi/euler-totient-exploration)

You can also try out this snippet to confirm the same, insert any valid prime number n

```js
function euclideanGcd(a, b) {
  if (a < b) return euclideanGcd(b, a)

  if (b === 0) return a

  return euclideanGcd(b, a % b)
}

/**
 * @param {number} n 
 */
function eulerPhiFunction(n){
  let counter = 0

  for (let k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
    const isNandKRelativelyPrime = euclideanGcd(n, k) === 1
    isNandKRelativelyPrime && counter++
  }

  return counter
}

const n = 7
const result = eulerPhiFunction(n)

console.log(result) // 6
```

So for a large prime number `n` $$œï(n) = n - 1$$

Euler's totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers p and q are relatively prime, then $$œï(pq) = œï(p)œï(q)$$

```
p = 7 & q = 11

œï(p) = p - 1 => œï(7) = 7 - 1 => 6
œï(q) = q - 1 => œï(11) = 11 - 1 => 10

œï(pq) = œï(p)œï(q) 
œï(7 * 11) = œï(7)œï(11)
œï(77) = 6 * 10
œï(77) = 60
```

Wait, why do we need this ? 

In order to choose a number `e` relatively prime to `œï(pq)`

```
gcd(e, œï(pq)) === 1
gcd(e, 60) === 1

eg. 

gcd(7, 60) = 1
gcd(13, 60) = 1 
.
.
e = 7,13 ... for œï(pq) = 60
```

* Summing up part 1

So far we have two parts to the algorithms which make up for the public key i.e 

- `n` -> `n = pq`
- `e` -> `œï(pq)` which helps choose a number `e` such that `gcd(e, œï(pq)) === 1`

## The Algorithm Part 2: Generating the private key

A couple of mathimatical concepts play a role in generating the private key. These are:

- Modulo Inverse
- Diophantine equation
- B√©zout's identity
- Extended Euclidean algorithm

In order to generate the private key we take the modular inverse `d of e modulo œï(pq).` where the resulting d is the private key. 

### So what is a Modulo inverse ?

For a quick revision of modular arithmatic and congruence modulo [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) & [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/congruence-modulo)

First of all, what is an inverse?

A number x when multiplied by its inverse results to 1. 

$$x * 1/x = 1$$
$$x * x^-1 = 1$$
$$7 * 1/7 = 1$$

- All real numbers other than 0 have an inverse
- Multiplying a number by the inverse of x is equivalent to dividing by x. (7/7 = 1)

A modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a is an integer x such that a*x is congruent to 1 modular some modulus m. To write it in a formal way: we want to find an integer x so that.

$$a*x ‚â° 1 mod m$$ 

which is equivalent to

$$a*x (mod m) = 1 $$

<!-- - Only the numbers coprime to m have a modular inverse (mod m) -->

The straight forward to calculate the modular inverse is to:
`Calculate a * x mod m for x values starting from 0 to m - 1.`

```js
Let a = 7, œï(pq) = m = 60
Calculate a * x mod m = 1, we have to find out x.

const a = 7
const m = 60

function equation(x) {
  return (a * x) % m
}

for (let x = 0; x < m; x++) {
  if (equation(x) === 1) {
    console.log(x) // 43
  }
}
```

Try out the snippet and by altering the values of a & m you will notice that a result is displayed for only the values for a & m when both are relatively prime. Since, only the numbers coprime to m have a modular inverse (mod m)

So, modular multiplicative inverse of 7 is 43 when 7*43 is congruent to 1 modulus 60

- Diophantine equation, Extended Euclidean algorithm And Bezout's Identity.

A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:
$$ ax + by = c $$
where a, b, c are given integers, and x, y are unknown integers.

For `c` let's have a look at Bezout's identity, the theorem goes as:
For nonzero integers a and b, let c be the greatest common divisor c = gcd(a,b). Then, there exist integers x and y such that
$$ ax + by = gcd(a, b) $$
$$ ax + by = c $$

One important application is, if a & b are relatively prime, we have gcd(a, b) = c = 1 

$$ ax + by = 1 $$

For small numbers a and b, we can make a guess as what numbers work. For example, in solving 3 x + 8 y = 13x+8y=1, we see that 3 * 3 + 8 * (-1) = 13√ó3+8√ó(‚àí1)=1. However, in solving 2014 x + 4021 y = 2014x+4021y=1, it is much harder to guess what the values are.

The way we find x,y is through the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. If you recall, the regular Euclidean Algorithm takes in a,b and then gives us the greatest common divisor, but the Extended Eucliden Algorithm takes a,b and then gives us the greatest common divisor d along with x,y.

--- Insert extended Euclidean algorithm ---

Now, to find the RSA private key, we need: `d of e modulo œï(pq).`

$$ d ‚â° e ^-1 (mod œï(pq)) $$
remember gcd(e, œï(pq)) = 1

Thus, by Bezout's Identity, we get there exist ùë•,ùë¶ such that:

$$ ex + (œï(pq))y = 1 $$
$$ ex = 1 - (œï(pq))y $$
take the above equation modulo `œï(pq)` to get:
$$ ex ‚â° 1 (œï(pq)) $$

Thus, x = d is the private key, so we can find the private key by figuring out x using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

* Summing up part 2

Now that the public and private keys have been generated, they can be reused as often as wanted.
